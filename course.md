## **ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT**

This is a *short guidance* for the Computer Vision course (TIF456), academic year of 2025-2026.


## **COURSE BASICS**

| **Item** | **Details** |
|----------|-------------|
| **Duration** | 16 weeks, 100 minutes/week |
| **Credits** | 2 SKS (Theory focus) |
| **Prerequisites** | Multimedia Systems, Discrete Math, Linear Algebra |
| **Approach** | Classical foundations first, then modern methods |

---

## **WHAT IS COMPUTER VISION?**

**Definition**: Teaching computers to "see" and understand visual information

**Examples You Know:**
- Smartphone face detection and filters
- Automatic photo tagging on social media
- QR code scanning and barcode readers
- Security cameras and access control

**What You'll Build**: Working applications for real problems like quality control, face recognition, document scanning, or object detection.

---

## **LEARNING APPROACH**

### **Course Philosophy**
```
Foundation First Strategy:
├── Classical Methods (Weeks 1-8) → Solid understanding
├── Modern Methods (Weeks 9-12) → Basic deep learning  
└── Applications (Weeks 13-16) → Specialized uses
```

### **Why Classical First?**
1. **Understand HOW algorithms work** (not just use them)
2. **Build problem-solving skills** for debugging and optimization
3. **Industry relevance** - many applications still use classical methods
4. **Better foundation** for understanding modern deep learning

## **ASSESSMENT & GRADING**

Plans for assessment and grading (tentative):

| **Component** | **Weight** | **Description** |
|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Semester Project** | 25% | Individual CV application |
| **Weekly Assignments** | 25% | Algorithm implementations |
| **Midterm Exam** | 20% | Classical CV theory |
| **Final Exam** | 25% | Comprehensive + project demo |
| **Participation** | 5% | Class engagement, attendance |

### **Key Assignments**
- **Weekly assignment**: Implement algorithms (Python + OpenCV)
- **Semester project**: Build complete CV application project (your choice of problem)
- **Exams**: Theory + practical application

---

## **REQUIRED TOOLS & SETUP**

### **Software**
```python
Essential Tools:
├── Python 3.x
├── OpenCV (cv2)
├── NumPy, Matplotlib
└── Jupyter Notebook

# Quick install command:
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

Alternatively, Google Colab platform can also be used, instead.

### **Hardware**
- **Computer**: Any laptop (4GB+ RAM recommended)
- **Camera**: Smartphone camera is sufficient, but additional camera may also be used

### **Resources**
- **Primary textbook**: Gonzalez & Woods "Digital Image Processing"
- **Online tutorials**: OpenCV-Python documentation
- **Course materials**: Available on course website (E-learning etc)

---

## **SEMESTER OVERVIEW**

Plans for the semester:

### **Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-8)**
- Image acquisition and processing fundamentals
- Feature detection and geometric vision
- Camera models and calibration
- Classical object recognition
- **Midterm Exam**

### **Phase 2: Modern Methods (Weeks 9-12)**
- Basic machine learning for vision
- Introduction to neural networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Object detection basics

### **Phase 3: Applications (Weeks 13-16)**
- Object tracking and biometric systems
- Document analysis and OCR
- **Final Exam + Project Presentations**

---

## **SUCCESS STRATEGIES**

### **To Succeed in This Course**
✅ **Keep up with weekly assignments** - practice is essential  
✅ **Start project early** - don't wait until end of semester  
✅ **Ask questions** - use office hours, lecture hours, and possibly online forums  
✅ **Practice coding regularly** - implementation skills need repetition  

### **Common Challenges**
- **Math complexity**: Focus on understanding concepts, not memorizing formulas
- **Programming difficulty**: Start with provided examples, build incrementally
- **Time management**: Expect 4-6 hours/week outside class

---

## **LIVE DEMO**

**Quick Demonstrations** (5 minutes each):
1. **Face detection** using webcam
2. **Object recognition** with smartphone
3. **Edge detection** comparison (classical vs modern)

**Purpose**: Show what you'll be able to build by semester end

---

## **NEXT STEPS**

### **Before Week 2**
1. **Install Python and OpenCV** (test with simple script)
2. **Get textbook** or access online resources
3. **Bring smartphone/camera** to next class
4. **Review basic image concepts** from Multimedia Systems

### **Week 2 Preview**
- **Topic**: Image Acquisition and Camera Systems
- **Activity**: Hands-on camera parameter exploration
- **Assignment**: Basic image analysis project
- **Reading**: Gonzalez & Woods Chapter 2.3-2.4

## **QUICK Q&A**

**Q: Do I need advanced math skills?**  
A: Basic understanding sufficient. We focus on practical implementation.

**Q: What if I'm new to Python?**  
A: Basic Python knowledge expected. Extra help available during office hours.

**Q: How do I choose a semester project?**  
A: Think about visual problems you encounter daily. Examples and guidance provided.

**Q: Is this course programming-heavy?**  
A: Yes and No - we focus on understanding of the concept, but also expect some practical works in forms of coding. But we provide examples and build skills gradually.
