	abstract = {This paper presents a literature review on the method of measuring high dynamic range (HDR) image quality. HDR technology can help maximize user satisfaction level when using HDR images-based visual services. The advance of HDR technology indirectly presents a more difficult challenge to the image quality assessment method due to the high sensitivity of the human visual system (HVS) to various kinds of distortions that may arise in HDR images. This is related to the process of HDR image generation, which in general can be classified into two broad categories: the formation using the multiple exposure fusion (MEF) method and the inverse tone mapping operator (ITMO) method. In this paper, we will outline how HDR image quality measurement method works and describe some examples of these measurement methods which are related to the way the HDR images are fabricated. From these methods, it can be seen that most of them are still focused on full-reference and no-reference quality models. We argue that there is still room for the development of reduced-reference HDR image quality assessment.},
