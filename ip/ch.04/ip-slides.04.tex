\vspace{-3ex}
\slidefig[0.55]{scale.jpg}
\vspace{-5ex}
\begin{titlelist}{}{}
\small
\item<2-> 
Contrast enhancing point functions we have discussed
earlier expand the dynamic range occupied by certain 
``interesting'' pixel
values in the input image.

\item<3-> 
These pixel values in the input image may be
difficult to distinguish and the goal of contrast enhancement
is to make them ``more visible'' in the output image.

\item<4-> 
Don't forget we have a limited dynamic range $(0-255)$ at
our disposal.

\end{titlelist}

\subsection{Point functions and Histograms}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Point functions and Histograms}
\begin{titlelist}{}{}

\item<2-> 
In general a \darkred{point operation/function} $B(i,j)=g(A(i,j))$
results in a new histogram $h_B(l)$ for the output image
that is different from $h_A(l)$.

\item<3-> 
The relationship between $h_B(l)$ and $h_A(l)$ may not be
straightforward as we have already discussed in previous lecture.

\item<4-> 
We {\em must} learn how to calculate $h_B(l)$ given $h_A(l)$
and the point function $g(l)$:

\begin{itemize}
\item<5-> 
\red{Exactly:} Usually via writing a matlab script that
computes $h_B(l)$ from $h_A(l)$ and $g(l)$.

\item<6-> 
\red{Approximately:} By sketching  $h_B(l)$
given the sketches for $h_A(l)$ and $g(l)$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Stretched/compressed pixel value ranges}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Stretched/compressed pixel value ranges}
\begin{titlelist}{}{}

\item<2-> $B(i,j)=g(A(i,j))$\\
Suppose $g(l)$ represents an {\em overall} point function which
includes contrast stretching/compression, emphasis/de-emphasis, rounding,
normalizing etc.

\item<3-> Given an image matrix ${\bf A}$, $B(i,j)=g(A(i,j))$ is also
an image matrix.

\item<4-> $g(l)$ may not be ``continuous'' or connected and it also
may not be composed of connected line segments.

\item<5-> How do we determine which pixel value ranges $g(l)$ 
stretches/compresses?
\begin{itemize}
\item<6-> 
We can usually assume that in small ranges $g(l)$ may be
approximated by piecewise linear, connected line segments.
Calculating the implied $\alpha_i$ and testing $|\alpha_i| \stackrel{>}{<} 1$
should help us determine stretched/compressed ranges.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Segmentation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Segmentation}
\begin{titlelist}{}{}
\small
\item<2-> If one views an image as depicting a scene
composed of different objects, regions, etc.
then \red{segmentation} is the 
decomposition of an image into these objects and regions 
by associating or ``labelling'' each pixel with the object that it corresponds to.

\item<3-> Most humans can easily segment an image. 

\item<4-> Computer automated segmentation is a difficult problem,
requiring sophisticated algorithms that work in tandem.

\item<5-> ``High level'' segmentation, such as segmenting humans,
cars etc., from an image is a very difficult problem.
It is still considered unsolved and is actively researched.

\item<6-> Based on point processing, histogram based image segmentation is a very simple algorithm
that is sometimes utilized as an initial guess at the ``true''
segmentation of an image.

\section{Histogram Based Image Segmentation}

\subsection{Methods}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Histogram Based Image Segmentation}
\begin{titlelist}{}{}

\item<2-> For a given image, decompose the range of pixel values $(0,\ldots, 255)$ into
``discrete'' intervals $R_t=[a_t,b_t],\ t=1,\ldots,T$, where $T$ is the total
number of segments. 

\item<3-> 
Each $R_t$ is typically obtained as a range of pixel
values that correspond to a \blue{hill} of $h_A(l)$.

\item<4-> 
``Label'' the pixels with pixel values within each $R_t$
via a point function. 

\item<5-> 
\red{Main Assumption:} Each object is assumed
to be composed of pixels with {\em similar} pixel values.

\end{titlelist}
\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Example}
\vspace{-6ex}
\slidefig[0.85]{claire.jpg}
\vspace{-6ex}
\begin{titlelist}{}{}
\small
\item<2-> 
$R_1=[0,14],R_2=[15, 15],R_3=[16, 99],
R_4=[100,149],R_5=[150,220],R_6=[221,255]$.

\item<3-> 
Labeling in matlab: $>> B1=255*((A>=0)\&(A<=14));$, etc.

\item<4-> 
This is what we did in the histogram slicing lecture last week

\end{titlelist}

($>> m1=sum(sum(B1.*A))/sum(sum(B1))$, etc.).

\item<3-> $C=m1\times B1+m2\times B2+m3\times B3+m4\times B4+
m5\times B5+m6\times B6$.\\
$B(i,j)=g_s^C(C(i,j))$.


\end{titlelist}
\end{slide}


\subsection{Limitations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Limitations}
\begin{titlelist}{}{}

\item<2-> Histogram based segmentation
operates on each image pixel independently.
As mentioned earlier, the main
assumption is that objects must be composed
of pixels with similar pixel values.

\item<3-> This independent processing ignores
a second important property: Pixels
within an object should be {\em spatially} connected.  
For example, B3, B4, B5 group spatially disconnected
objects/regions into the same segment.

\item<4-> In practice, one would use histogram based segmentation
in tandem with other algorithms
that make sure that computed objects/regions
are spatially connected.

\end{titlelist}

\section{Histogram Equalization}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Histogram Equalization}
\begin{titlelist}{}{}
\small
\item<2-> For a given image ${\bf A}$, we will now
design a special point function \darkred{$g_A^e(l)$} which
is called \darkred{the histogram equalizing point function
for ${\bf A}$}.

\item<3-> If $B(i,j)=g_A^e(A(i,j))$, then our aim is to make
$h_B(l)$ \blue{as uniform/flat as possible {\em irrespective}
of $h_A(l)$!}

\item<4-> Histogram equalization will help us:
\begin{itemize}\scriptsize
\item<5-> Stretch/Compress an image such that:
	\begin{itemize}\scriptsize
	\item Pixel values that occur frequently in ${\bf A}$ occupy
	a bigger dynamic range in ${\bf B}$, i.e., get stretched and become more
	visible.
	\item Pixel values that occur infrequently in ${\bf A}$ occupy
	a smaller dynamic range in ${\bf B}$, i.e., get compressed and become less
	visible.
	\end{itemize}
\item<6-> Compare images by ``mapping'' their histograms into a standard
histogram and sometimes ``undo'' the effects of some unknown processing.
\end{itemize}

\item<7-> The techniques we are going to use to get $g_A^e(l)$
are also applicable in histogram modification/specification.

\end{titlelist}
\end{slide}


\subsection{Random Variable}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Random Variables (RV)}
\begin{titlelist}{}{}
\small
\item<2-> A random variable, $\chi$, is a real-valued function defined on the events of the sample space, $S$.  

\item<3-> In other words, for each event in $S$, there is a real number that is the corresponding value of the random variable.  

\item<4-> Viewed yet another way, a \blue{random variable maps each event in $S$ onto the real line}. 

\item<5-> Example:
\begin{itemize}

\item<6-> 
consider the experiment of throwing a single die and observing the value of the up-face.  

\item<7-> 
We can define a random variable as the numerical outcome of the experiment (i.e., 1 through 6), but there are many other possibilities.  

\item<8-> 
For example, a binary random variable could be defined simply by letting $\chi = 0$ represent the event that the outcome of a throw is an even number and $\chi=1$ otherwise.
%represent the event that the outcome of throw is an even number and $\chi = 1$ otherwise.

\end{itemize}
%\item<9-> 
%\item<10-> 

\end{titlelist}

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Random Variables (RV)}
\begin{titlelist}{}{}
\small
\item<2-> In the discrete case, the probabilities of events are numbers between 0 and 1.  

\item<3-> Later we shall see that the gray levels in an image may be viewed as random variables in the interval $[0,1]$

\item<4-> Probability Density Function (PDF) is one of the fundamental descriptors of a random variable


\item<5-> 
However when dealing with continuous quantities (which are not denumerable) we can no longer talk about the "probability of an event" because that probability is zero. 

\item<6-> 
Thus in continuous case, instead of talking about the probability of a specific value, we talk about the probability that the value of the random variable lies in a specified range.  
\begin{itemize}
\scriptsize
\item<7-> 
In particular, we are interested in the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to (or, similarly, greater than or equal to) a specified constant $a$.  

\item<8-> 
Usually this is written as $ F_{\chi}(a) = P \left( \chi \leq a\right) $
\end{itemize}
%represent the event that the outcome of throw is an even number and $\chi = 1$ otherwise.

%\item<9-> 
%\item<10-> 

\end{titlelist}

\end{slide}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Transformation of Random Variable}
\begin{titlelist}{}{}

\item<2-> 
Suppose that a random variable $\chi$ is transformed by a monotonic transformation function $T(\chi)$ to produce a new random variable $Y$, 

\item<3-> 
Then the probability density function of $Y$ can be obtained from knowledge of $T(\chi)$ and the probability density function of $\chi$, as follows:
\vspace{-2ex}
\[ f_{Y}(y) = f_{\chi}(x) \left| \dfrac{dx}{dy} \right| \]

\item<4-> Applied to image:


\begin{center}
\onslide<5->
\mbox{The PDF of the transformed variable (output image)}\\
\onslide<6->
\mbox{is determined by}\\
\onslide<7->
\mbox{The PDF of the input image; and}\\
\onslide<8->
\mbox{the chosen transformation function}
\end{center}

\item Properties:
\begin{eqnarray}
F_{\chi}(x)&=&\int_{-\infty}^{x} f_{\chi}(t)dt  \Rightarrow  {dF_{\chi}(x)\over

\label{eq:deriv}

\begin{eqnarray}
f_{\chi}(x)&\geq&0  \Rightarrow  F_{\chi}(x)\geq 0,\ F_{\chi}(x+dx)-F_{\chi}(x)\geq 0
\label{eq:incr}
\end{eqnarray}
$F_{\chi}(x)$ is a non-decreasing function.
\begin{eqnarray}
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f_{\chi}(t)dt &=&1 \Rightarrow
f_{\chi}(x)|_{x=+/-\infty}=0 \\
F_{\chi}(x)|_{x=+\infty}&=&1 \\

$N=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}f_{\chi}(x)dx=1$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Main Derivation}
\begin{titlelist}{}{}

\item<2-> 
We will now obtain a new random variable $Y$ $(f_Y(y),F_Y(y))$ \red{as
a {\em function} of the random variable $\chi$}, i.e., $Y=g(\chi)$.

\item<3-> 
We wish to make $Y$ a uniform random variable
(a random variable having the uniform probability density
function) \blue{irrespective} of the density of $\chi$.

\item<4-> 
Our main assumption will be:

\begin{itemize}
\item<5-> 
Assume $F_{\chi}(x)$ is a continuous and strictly increasing function
(compared to the general case of non-decreasing as in Equation~\eqref{eq:incr})
\item<6-> Note that such an $F_{\chi}(x)$ is one-to-one which
will allow us to use its inverse $F_{\chi}^{-1}(x)$.
\end{itemize}

\end{titlelist}

\end{slide}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Main Derivation (cont'd)}

\begin{titlelist}{}{}
\scriptsize
\item<2-> 
Let $Y=F_{\chi}(\chi)$, i.e., $g(\chi)=F_{\chi}(\chi)$.
Note that $Y \in [0,1]$ and $f_Y(y)=0$ if $y\not\in [0,1]$.

\item<3-> 
Let us derive $F_Y(y)$ for $y\in [0,1]$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{Y}(y)&=&\mbox{Probability}(Y \leq y)\\
&=&\mbox{Probability}(F_{\chi}(\chi) \leq y)\\
&=&\mbox{Probability}(\chi \leq F_{\chi}^{-1}(y))\\
&=&F_{\chi}(F_{\chi}^{-1}(y)) \\
&=&y 
\end{eqnarray*}
where the next to last step follows from Equation \eqref{eq:Fdef}.

\item<4-> 
Using Equation \eqref{eq:deriv}  and $f_Y(y)=0$ if $y\not\in [0,1]$,
we have
\begin{eqnarray}
f_Y(y)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
0 & y<0,\ y>1 \\
1 & y\in [0,1]
\end{array}\right.
\end{eqnarray}
i.e., $Y$ is a uniform random variable with \hyperlink{unif}{$a=0$ and $b=1$} .

\begin{eqnarray}

\begin{itemize}
\small
\item For a given image ${\bf A}$,
consider the image pixels as the realizations of
a discrete amplitude random variable ``$A$''.
\begin{itemize}\scriptsize
\item For example suppose we toss a coin {(Heads=$255$ and Tails=$0$)}
$N\times M$ times and record the results as an $N$ by $M$ image matrix.
\end{itemize}
\item Define the sample probability mass function $p_{A}(l)$
as the probability of a randomly chosen pixel having the value $l$.
\begin{eqnarray}
p_{A}(l)={h_A(l) \over NM}
\end{eqnarray}
\item Note that the sample mean and variance we talked about
in previous lecture can be calculated as:
\begin{eqnarray*}
m_A&=&\sum_{l=0}^{255} l p_A(l) \\
\sigma^2_A&=&\sum_{l=0}^{255} (l-m_A)^2 p_A(l)

\begin{slide}{Histogram Matching -- Specification}
\begin{titlelist}{}{}

\item<2-> 
Given {\em images} ${\bf A}$ and ${\bf B}$,
using point processing
we would like to generate an image 
${\bf C}$ \blue{from ${\bf A}$}
such that $h_C(l)\sim h_B(l),\ (l=0,\ldots, 255)$.

\item<3-> 
More generally, given an image ${\bf A}$
and a histogram $h_B(l)$ {(or sample probability mass function
$p_B(l)$)}, we would like to generate an image 
${\bf C}$ such that $h_C(l)\sim h_B(l),\ (l=0,\ldots, 255)$.

\item<4-> 
Histogram matching/specification enables us
to ``match'' the grayscale distribution in one
image to  the grayscale distribution in another image.

\begin{slide}{Derivation for Continuous Amplitude R.V.s}
\begin{titlelist}{}{}
\scriptsize
\item<2-> 
We have already seen that for a continuous amplitude random variable
$\chi$ with strictly increasing and continuous $F_{\chi}(x)$,
the random variable $Y=F_{\chi}(\chi)$ has the uniform
probability density/distribution function.

\item<3-> 
\green{{\em Equivalently}}, for a continuous amplitude random variable
$Y\in [0,1]$ which has the uniform probability density function,
$\chi=F_{\chi}^{-1}(Y)$ has the probability density [distribution] function
$f_{\chi}(x)$ $[F_{\chi}(x)]$.
\vspace{-3ex}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\chi \ [F_{\chi}(x)] &\Rightarrow &Y=F_{\chi}(\chi) \ [\mbox{ uniform}]\\
Y \ [\mbox{uniform}] &\Rightarrow &\chi=F_{\chi}^{-1}(Y) \ [F_{\chi}(x)]
\end{eqnarray*}

\item<4-> 
\red{Now,} assume we have a continuous amplitude random variable
$Z$ with strictly increasing and continuous $F_{Z}(z).$
Then:
\vspace{-2ex}
\begin{eqnarray}
Y \ (\mbox{uniform}) &\Rightarrow &W=F_{Z}^{-1}(Y) \ [F_{Z}(w)]
\end{eqnarray}
but we can generate the required uniform random variable $Y$
from $\chi$ via $Y=F_{\chi}(\chi)$ which means $W$ can be generated 
\blue{from $\chi$} via:
\vspace{-2ex}
\begin{eqnarray}
W=F_{Z}^{-1}(Y)=F_{Z}^{-1}(F_{\chi}(\chi))
\end{eqnarray}
